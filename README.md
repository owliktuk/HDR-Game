# HDR-Game

This simple application present basic model from evolutionary game theory. It calculates the evolution of population with up to three different strategies. There are three predefined games: Hawk-Dove (Prisoners Dillema), Hawk-Dove-Retaliator and Hawk-Dove-Bully. For scientific details see Matt Ridley, The Origins of Virtue, Viking 1996 and http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~doebeli/reprints/killingback_doebeli_1996.pdf.

The evolution of the population is presented on a triangle diagram with gnuplot.
